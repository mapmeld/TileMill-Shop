<h3>TileMill-Shop or Tintplates</h3>

Simple, well-designed data tables whenever you mouse over items on the map!
And they're <i>too</i> easy to set up!

<h3>Install</h3>
Mac OS X Terminal one-liner:
<code>cp -r TileMill-Shop /Applications/TileMill.app/Contents/Resources/plugins/</code>

<h3>What to do</h3>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/PVRoo.png"/>

<ul>
<li>Click on the new circle/database icon above the standard legend/teaser setup</li>
<li>Select the layer you want data-tabled</li>
<li>Make edits to the code if you want</li>
<li>Hide the popup and click Save to re-draw the map</li>
<li>Put your mouse over stuff</li>
</ul>

<h3>Perfect for OpenStreetMap</h3>
OpenStreetMap data has tons of columns but each object uses only a few of them.

Instead of writing out your own table, and learning the Mustache formatting language, just select your layer and go.

You'll see all of the object's attributes which have information, and none of the ones which are blank.
